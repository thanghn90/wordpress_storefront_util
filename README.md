# Wordpress Utility Scripts
Various scripts and notes on how to make a shop website with wordpress involving migration from wamp and docker setup. I made these scripts while helping my friend build his shop website using Wordpress in Windows and intend to migrate to a Linux host later on.

# Disabling unwanted image sizes auto-generated by Wordpress
If you're running Wordpress in Windows through WAMP, download [disable_unwanted_image_sizes.bat](https://github.com/thanghn90/wordpress_storefront_util/blob/main/disable_unwanted_image_sizes.bat) and [disable_unwanted_image_sizes.py](https://github.com/thanghn90/wordpress_storefront_util/blob/main/disable_unwanted_image_sizes.py). You also need to install python (any version). Then modify the "PATH" variable definition in disable_unwanted_image_sizes.bat to point to the directory where python.exe is located (default is %localappdata%\Programs\Python\Python310 for python 3.10.x). Then double click on the bat file to run it. It will prompt you to specify the path to your wordpress directory (default is C:\wamp64\www\wordpress). The bat file then invoke the "disable_unwanted_image_sizes.py" python script to search and replace/comment out lines of code in wordpress (particularly, woocommerce) that causes extra image sizes generation. As of current writing, the WooCommerce plugin of Wordpress (with Storefront theme by default) only utilize 100x100 thumbnail, 300x300 thumbnail, and "scaled" image sizes. By removing image size threshold, Wordpress will use original image size in place of "scaled" size.

To do: write a .sh equivalent of .bat
