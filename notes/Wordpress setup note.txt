For Windows:
- Need WAMP. Tested with both MySQL and MariaDB, both works with latest Wordpress 6.2. Not sure how it would work with real Linux host.
Given the outdated nature of Vietnam Hosts, I don't expect it to work directly with MariaDB, but who knows...
Update 20230419: Ok, MariaDB and MySQL should work interchangably.
Just make sure to specify the port to either MariaDB or MySQL (default to 3307 and 3306, respectively) when setting up Wordpress the first time, 
or modify the wp-config.php, "DB_HOST" set to localhost:port
- The quickest way to set up a shop website is to use WooCommerce + Storefront plugins.
- Can modify home page to directly load shop page.
- Need to add a menu to override the default one in primary (desktop) view.
- Some guide online use Contact Form 7 to design a "Contact us" page that submit an email to the admin.
- May need to test Jetpack on actual Linux host to see if it works. For now, I'm only interested in speed + CDN.
- For ads, may need google analytics and tiktok video campaign - maybe later.
