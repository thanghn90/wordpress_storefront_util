I didn't think waiting was so important.

Looks like someone is really into making wordpress becoming a docker image!
So wordpress is on docker hub. Just need to pull it in, set it up, and somehow figure out how to link it with backedup website and database
Looks like we only need to either "bind mount" or create a volume to point to a specific container's path.
