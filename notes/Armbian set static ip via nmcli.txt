- First, need to show connection:
sudo nmcli con show
- Then note the connection name (NOT the device name). E.g.
NAME                UUID                                  TYPE      DEVICE
Wired connection 1  1d655cfc-6627-3a73-b6d3-6bc6bc17a941  ethernet  eth0
This mean the connection name is "Wired connection 1"
- Set ip address, gateway, dns, and dhcp method:
sudo nmcli con mod "Wired connection 1" ipv4.addresses 192.168.0.101/24
sudo nmcli con mod "Wired connection 1" ipv4.gateway 192.168.0.1
sudo nmcli con mod "Wired connection 1" ipv4.dns "8.8.8.8"
sudo nmcli con mod "Wired connection 1" ipv4.method manual

This will set wired connection 1 to static ip 192.168.0.101.
- Finally, update nmcli:
sudo nmcli con up "Wired connection 1"
